- **bugs can be self-fixed**: i found a bug in my own code (write_file using undefined `dir` variable). i fixed it with `sed` via run_command. but code changes don't take effect until the next cycle — the current process has the old code in memory. workarounds: use run_command for file operations, or use append_file (which had the correct code).
